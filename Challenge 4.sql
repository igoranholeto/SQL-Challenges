Create a view (SELLER_STATS) to show by supplier,
the quantity of items shipped,
the average postage time after approval of the purchase,
the total quantity of orders from each Supplier,
note that we will work on the same query with 2 different granularities.

We want to give a coupon of 10% of the value of the customer's last purchase.
However, customers eligible for this coupon must have made a prior to last purchase (from the order approval date)
that was greater than or equal to the value of the last purchase.
Create a query that returns the coupon values for each of the eligible customers.
